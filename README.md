# SBSPS-Challenge-741-Predicting-the-energy-output-of-wind-turbine-based-on-weather-condition
Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site.
If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly
overproduction.

Better prediction models for the upcoming supply of renewable energy are important to decrease the need of controlling energy provided by conventional power plants.

Hereby, we formulate the prediction task as regression problem and test different regression techniques such as linear regression, Random Forest and Long short term memory.
In our experiments, we analyze predictions for individual turbines and show that a machine learning approach yields feasible results for short-term wind power prediction.
As it is a predictive type problem We use various regression methods to solve it .
We also use node red to make this solution user-friendly.
We create app.py file to connect the model using streamlit for front end view and to support that file we create model.pkl and windenergyprediction.py file .
